                    RAG CHATBOT - PROJECT OVERVIEW
================================================================================

PROJECT NAME: Document Q&A RAG Chatbot (Single User Edition)

CREATED: November 2025
LAST UPDATED: December 2025

================================================================================
WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?
================================================================================

This is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot application that allows
users to upload documents and ask questions about them using AI. The AI 
retrieves relevant information from your uploaded documents to provide accurate,
context-aware answers.

Think of it as your personal AI assistant that can read and understand your 
documents, then answer questions based on what it learned from them.

================================================================================
KEY FEATURES
================================================================================

1. SIMPLE AUTHENTICATION
   - Single password protection (no complex user management)
   - SHA-256 hashed password for security
   - No database required for authentication

2. DOCUMENT PROCESSING
   - Upload and process .txt, .md, and .html files
   - Automatic text chunking for optimal retrieval
   - Semantic embeddings for intelligent search

3. AI-POWERED CHAT
   - Support for OpenAI GPT models (GPT-4.1, GPT-5, etc.)
   - Support for Google Gemini models (Gemini 2.0/2.5)
   - Streaming responses for real-time interaction

4. RAG (RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION)
   - Semantic search using vector embeddings
   - Configurable Top-K chunk retrieval
   - Grounding metrics to show AI's reliance on your documents

5. DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT
   - View all processed documents
   - Delete unwanted documents
   - Reload document library

================================================================================
HOW IT WORKS
================================================================================

STEP 1: DOCUMENT UPLOAD
   User uploads a document (.txt, .md, or .html file)
   ↓
STEP 2: PROCESSING
   Document is split into chunks with overlap for context
   ↓
STEP 3: EMBEDDING GENERATION
   Each chunk is converted to a vector embedding using OpenAI's API
   ↓
STEP 4: STORAGE
   Embeddings and chunks are stored in JSON files locally
   ↓
STEP 5: QUESTION ANSWERING
   User asks a question
   ↓
STEP 6: RETRIEVAL
   System finds the most relevant chunks using semantic similarity
   ↓
STEP 7: GENERATION
   AI generates an answer using the retrieved chunks as context
   ↓
STEP 8: RESPONSE
   User receives answer with source citations

================================================================================

================================================================================
DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS
================================================================================

LOCAL DEVELOPMENT:
   - Run on your computer using: streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   - Default password: admin123
   - Requires Python 3.8+ and dependencies

CLOUD DEPLOYMENT:
   - Deploy to Streamlit Cloud (FREE)
   - No server management required
   - Automatic HTTPS and custom domain support
   - Secrets management for API keys

================================================================================
COST STRUCTURE
================================================================================

INFRASTRUCTURE: FREE
   - Streamlit Cloud free tier
   - No database hosting costs
   - No server costs

VARIABLE COSTS:
   - OpenAI API usage (embeddings + chat)
   - Google Gemini API usage (if using Gemini models)
   - Pay only for what you use

================================================================================
PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS
================================================================================

✓ Batched Embedding Generation (10x faster than sequential)
✓ Vectorized Similarity Search (100x faster than loops)
✓ Pre-filtering for Selected Documents (reduces search space)
✓ Instant Startup (no database connection overhead)
✓ Efficient Chunking with Overlap (better context preservation)

================================================================================
SECURITY FEATURES
================================================================================

✓ Password hashing with SHA-256
✓ No plain text password storage
✓ Secrets managed by Streamlit Cloud
✓ API keys stored in environment variables
✓ Safe for public deployment

================================================================================
LIMITATIONS
================================================================================

✗ Single user only (no multi-user support)
✗ In-memory vector store (not suitable for massive datasets)
✗ No user management or role-based access
✗ Documents persist locally (not distributed storage)
✗ No collaborative features

================================================================================
PROJECT EVOLUTION
================================================================================

PREVIOUS VERSIONS:
   - Originally included MongoDB integration for multi-user support
   - Had Flask-based authentication with sign-up/sign-in pages
   - Complex user profile management

CURRENT VERSION:
   - Simplified to single-user static authentication
   - Removed MongoDB dependency
   - Removed Flask authentication server
   - Streamlined for ease of deployment

REASON FOR CHANGE:
   - Simplicity and ease of deployment
   - Reduced infrastructure requirements
   - Lower barrier to entry for users
   - Free deployment on Streamlit Cloud

================================================================================
