<p>Rahu and Ketu are shadowy planets. Their movement is interrelated and as parts of one body they are at all times just opposite to each other but keeping in view of aspect (drishti), they can be regarded together.
In general, Rahu carries the positive and beneficial tone of Jupiter and hence stands for growth and development and self help while Ketu expresses the restrictions and obstacles of Saturn and hence thought to restrict growth. In this way Rahu represents positive objectives and Ketu denotes the easy way out with little opportunity for growth.
Thus Rahu signifies materialism and desires, whereas Ketu signifies spiritual tendencies and process of the refinement of materialization to spirit but obstacles in the material realm. Rahu is considered to be wile, deceitful and dishonest.</p>

<p>Testery, as you are born in Swati star, your star lord is Rahu. You always act and think independently in life. Therefore, you may face difficulties in overcoming troubled times. 
On the basis of the birth star, the Dasa periods of some planets may be generally unfavorable to you. The birth star being Swati suggests that you may have adverse experiences during the dasa periods of Saturn, Kethu and Sun.</p>

<p>There will be a number of visible changes in your thoughts and actions during this period. Materialistic desires may grow unlimitedly. Unexpected impediments may arise in marital matters. Don't make your relatives brand you as a hot-tempered person. The inclination towards unprofitable things will be more during this period. Don't let fantasies drive your actions.</p>

<p>The lord of the birth sign Tula is Venus. Therefore, you will get opportunities to present a distinct outlook on aesthetics and in the fields of arts and sports. Extra effort will be needed to elevate your mind to a higher emotional plane. Recognition of your virtue, even by those close to you, will take time. 
Avoid transactions and auspicious functions in the unfavourable stars of Anuradha, Moola, Uttarashada,  Krittika (Mesha sign), Rohini and Mrigasira (Vrishabha sign).</p>

<p>You must practice restraining your words and behaviour during the unfavourable Dasa periods, especially on the hostile stars. Try to stay away from unnecessary tussles. It is best not to interfere in others' matters during this period.</p>

<p>Practicing customary remedial measures will help to mitigate the negative effects.</p>
<h2>Remedies based on your star (Swati)</h2>
<h3>Problems & Obstacles,Remedies</h3>

<p>Praying regularly to Rahu and Serpent Lord, particularly during the hostile Dasa period, is considered to be beneficial. For better results, visit the temples of Serpent lord and pray to Rahu on the birth star of Swati and on the associated stars of Satabhisha and Ardra. It is also considered extremely auspicious to observe fast on Fridays, which fall on Swati star.</p>

<p>Pray daily to the lord of the star, Rahu, to get good results. Planting the Neermaruthu tree at an appropriate place is also beneficial. Selecting and wearing white, black and light blue dresses is considered yet another way to appease Rahu and Venus.</p>+

<p>Besides, measures to please the lord of the sign, Venus will bring good prospects.</p>

<p>Wind is the lord of Swati star. Chant faithfully any of the following Mantras to appease Lord Wind and receive good prospects:</p>
<table><tr><td>Om vaayo ye the sahasrino</tr></td>

<tr><td>Radhaasasthebiraagahi nithyuthwaana soma peethaye.</tr></td></table>
<table><tr><td>Om vaayave namaha</tr></td></table>

<p>Besides, nurturing plants, animals and birds is considered highly auspicious. Especially, keep off from harming buffalo, the animal of Swati star. Also, please avoid buffalo meat from your food. Try to plant and grow Neermaruthu, the official tree of Swati. Do not harm crow, the official bird of Swati and if possible feed them. The element of Swati is Fire. Ancient astrologers testify that worshipping the lord of fire and lighting lamps during twilight will bring good luck to the people born in this star.</p>
