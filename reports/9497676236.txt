<h1>AshtakaVarga Predictions</h1>

<h2>Remedies,Problems & Obstacles,Personality & Self-Awareness</h2>
<p>Ashtakavarga system is a predictive method of Indian Astrology that uses a system of points based upon planetary positions. Ashtakavarga means eightfold categorization. It depicts eightfold strength of planets excluding the nodes of the Moon but including the ascendant. It is worked out according to certain well-established rules for measuring the planetary strength. The strength of each planet and the power and intensity of their influence depends upon the location of other planets and the ascendant in relation to it. Eight full points are assigned to each planet. They can obtain strength varying from zero to 8 points which, plotted on different signs in a chart, determine the possibility of a transiting planet in inducing auspicious or other effects during its sojourn in a particular sign. Events and their timings are to a large extent determined by the positioning of particular points. Depending on their negative or positive influences the native can take remedial measures or pre-empt unpleasant possibilities, just by being aware of the likely consequences.
