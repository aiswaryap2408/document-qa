In general, Rahu carries the positive and beneficial tone of Jupiter and hence stands for growth and development and self help while Ketu expresses the restrictions and obstacles of Saturn and hence thought to restrict growth. In this way Rahu represents positive objectives and Ketu denotes the easy way out with little opportunity for growth.
Thus Rahu signifies materialism and desires, whereas Ketu signifies spiritual tendencies and process of the refinement of materialization to spirit but obstacles in the material realm. Rahu is considered to be wile, deceitful and dishonest.</p>

<h2>Personality & Self-Awareness,Problems & Obstacles,Family & Relatives,Remedies</h2>

<p>Aiswarya, as you are born in Anuradha star, your star lord is Saturn. You are such a kind of  person who tries to bring your ideas into practice. Hence you may have to wait for sometime to gain emotional consistency in life. 
On the basis of the birth star, the Dasa periods of some planets may be generally unfavorable to you. The birth star being Anuradha suggests that you may have adverse experiences during the dasa periods of Kethu, Sun and Mars.</p>

<p>There will be a number of visible changes in your feelings, thoughts and actions during this period. Your mind may be disturbed for seemingly small matters. Very often, your kin may feel that you are becoming too adamant. Baseless sorrows must be nipped in bud. You may need to act decisively in many situations.</p>

<p>The lord of the birth sign Vrischika is Mars. Therefore situations may arise which demand sharpness and enthusiasm in character. Spare a thought to the effect of your independent nature on the life of others. Your ability to tackle opposition will receive acknowledgement only after considerable amount of time. 
Avoid transactions and auspicious functions in the unfavourable stars of Moola, Uttarashada, Dhanishta,Mrigasira (Mithuna sign), Ardra and Punarvasu (Mithuna sign).</p>

<p>You must practice restraining your words and behaviour during the unfavourable Dasa periods, especially on the hostile stars. Try to stay away from unnecessary tussles. It is best not to interfere in others' matters during this period.</p>

<p>Practicing customary remedial measures will help to mitigate the negative effects.</p>
<h2>Remedies based on your star (Anuradha)</h2>
<h3>Remedies,Problems & Obstacles</h3>

<p>Praying regularly to Lord Shiva and Lord Ayyappa, particularly during the hostile Dasa period, is considered to be beneficial. For better results, visit the temples on the birth star of Anuradha and on the associated stars of Uttarabhadra and Pushya. It is also considered very auspicious to observe fast with purity on Saturdays, which fall on Anuradha star.</p>

<p>Pray daily to the lord of the star, Saturn, to get good results. Besides, it is best to skip rice meal once on Saturdays.</p>+

<p>Besides, measures to please the lord of the sign Mars will bear fruit. Selecting and wearing black, dark blue and red dresses will appease both the lord of the star and Rasi.</p>

<p>Mithran is the lord of Anuradha star. Chant faithfully any of the following Mantras to appease Mithran, one of the Adityans mentioned in the Rig Veda, and receive good prospects:</p>
<table><tr><td>Om namo mithrasya varunasya chakshase</tr></td>

<tr><td>Mahaadevaaya thadhritham sacharyatham dooradhrmshe</tr></td>

<tr><td>Devajaathaaya kethave dhivasputhraaya</tr></td>

<tr><td>Suryaya samsatha</tr></td></table>
<table><tr><td>Om mithraaya namaha</tr></td></table>

<p>Besides, nurturing plants, animals and birds is considered highly auspicious. Especially, avoid harming deer, the animal of Anuradha star, and taking deer meat. Try to plant and grow Ilanji, the official tree of Anuradha and do not cut its branches. Do not harm crow, the official bird of Anuradha and if possible feed them. The element of Anuradha is Fire.

<h3>Fasting (Vratham)</h3>
<p>The term 'fasting' signifies the practice of frugality in the consumption of food materials. Above all, the ultimate motive of fasting and observing rites is to attain all kinds of purity by subduing your body, mind and utterance. You should fast on the days which are relevant to the planet and the days special to you. As Rahu don't have any dominating day in the week, worshipping Naga gods and visiting Naga temples while fasting on every birth star day is beneficial. You can also fast on the star days like Ardra, Swati, Satabhisha, and on Sundays.
Abstain from consuming alcohol, non-vegetarian foods and other intoxicants while fasting. Natural foods like fruits, vegetables, and green leaves- which help digestion- are the suitable food for these days. Refrain from eating cereals, oily, hot and sour food. You can fast partially or fully according to the intensity of the harmful effects. It is not appropriate to indulge in pomp and pleasure while fasting. Your fasting will be fruitful only if you restrict your expression and emotion.</p>

<p>Ashtakavarga system is a predictive method of Indian Astrology that uses a system of points based upon planetary positions. Ashtakavarga means eightfold categorization. It depicts eightfold strength of planets excluding the nodes of the Moon but including the ascendant. It is worked out according to certain well-established rules for measuring the planetary strength. The strength of each planet and the power and intensity of their influence depends upon the location of other planets and the ascendant in relation to it. Eight full points are assigned to each planet. They can obtain strength varying from zero to 8 points which, plotted on different signs in a chart, determine the possibility of a transiting planet in inducing auspicious or other effects during its sojourn in a particular sign. Events and their timings are to a large extent determined by the positioning of particular points. Depending on their negative or positive influences the native can take remedial measures or pre-empt unpleasant possibilities, just by being aware of the likely consequences.
