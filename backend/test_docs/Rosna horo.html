    <h1>Bhava Predictions</h1>

    <h2>Your personality, physical structure, status</h2>
    <p>Predictions based on your 1st Bhava</p>
    <p>The first house of the horoscope represents the personality characteristics, physical structure, status and fame
        of the person.</p>
    <p>Rosna, based on the position of Lagna the following characteristics may be present in your personality. You are:
        extremely sensitive; inquisitive; nervous; restless; intelligent; quick-witted; bright, hard-working; pleasure
        loving; talkative, self-reliant; honest; happy; strongly emotional; just and fair; family-oriented; cautious.

        possessions. You are receptive to new ideas and adapt yourself to the environment. You often meet with
        disappointment in love, because you feel others do not give you as much love as you give them.

        Rosna, since your Lagna lies in the second Drekkana of its house, you are not very lucky in financial matters.
        You are very kind and generous. But this tendency is counter-productive to money retention. You should not make
        risky deals or unwise investments. Lawsuits and blackmail play a large part in losing your money. However, you
        will also be fortunate under certain circumstances. The most important years in your life are 18, 27, 34, 44, 53
        &amp; 60.

        Since the ascendant lord is in the 6th, you will be courageous and scrupulous. You will make or inherit money.
        You have the capacity to be conniving or shrewd. You will accumulate debt, but you will also have the
        wherewithal to pay off those debts. You may be in the armed services or achieve a position of power in the world
        of finance. You may, on the other hand, work in the field of health services. Your career or education may be
        influenced by your brothers.

        The aspect of Saturn on the first house, seen in your horoscope, is not a good indication and it is essential
        that you take all efforts to keep away from unclean environment and doubtful company of friends.</p>


    <h2>Wealth, land and properties</h2>
    <p>Predictions based on your 2nd Bhava</p>
    <p>Land and properties, wealth, family, speech, food and skills are some of the important topics highlighted by the
        second house in a horoscope.</p>
    <p>Rosna, as the 2nd lord is in the 4th, you will have opportunity to accumulate much wealth. Emotionally, you are
        dependant on physical manifestations of love. You see the need to develop a permanent, hard, protective shell
        against the world to shield yourself from those you consider your adversaries. You will be thrifty in money
        dealings. You will do well financially from dealings with cars, land, or commissions. You will be assisted by
        your maternal relatives.

        Since the second lord is aspected by the seventh lord, there are chances of your gaining wealth supported by
        your life partner.</p>


    <h2>Siblings</h2>
    <p>Predictions based on your 3rd Bhava</p>

        life. Your married life will be happy as you and your spouse will usually forgive and forget everything, even
        the most cruel confrontations. Anyone who deals with you will sense and respond to your desperate need to be
        appreciated and helped. You will be highly benefited by your brothers. You will do well in agriculture, and will
        be welcomed by a rich family.

        Since Jupiter happens to be in the 3rd house, you have a photographic memory, capable of grasping the details of
        even complicated situations at a glance. You will be well liked by the opposite sex. You may be thrifty, but you
        do not neglect to help your family.

        A benefic planet is located in the third house reinforces the longevity of your siblings.</p>

    <h2>Property, education</h2>
    <p>Predictions based on your 4th Bhava</p>
    <p>The fourth house of your horoscope refers to property, education, mother, vehicles, and general happiness.</p>
    <p>Rosna, as the 4th lord is in the 5th, you are good at maintaining good relationships with men. You will learn
        well from your mother's guidance. As an adult, you will probably make your own money. Your husband will probably
        be more bossy and domineering than you are. But, he will also do well financially and he will help provide
        comforts and luxuries for the family.

        As Venus is the lord of the 4th house, you will show an interest in poetry, even in childhood. Later, you will
        be known as a philosophical and contemplative woman. There is a touch of music, art and finesse in all you do.
        You are more of a dreamer than a doer. No one can win your attention or approval by trivial arguments or deceit.

        Since the Sun is seen occupying the fourth, you are likely to be unnecessarily anxious. This tendency is
        worrisome, and irritating to those around you. You will change locations often. This position of the planets
        promises some inheritance. You will be interested in philosophical discussions. You are advised to avoid
        politics.

        You have inborn talent and taste for studies connected with humanities such as political science, language
        studies, psychology and metaphysics. You will do well when employed in areas where human interaction is
        important.</p>

    <h2>Children, mind, intelligence</h2>
    <p>Predictions based on your 5th Bhava</p>

        Venus is placed in the 5th house. As it is easy to please and displease you. People think you are capricious and
        indiscriminate. You enjoy speculation.

        Rahu is placed in the 5th house. You may worry about your children. Your stomach will be sensitive. As you are
        analytical and logical in speaking, others may think you hard-hearted.

        Rosna, since the 5th lord is in the 12th, you may not wish to or be able to have children. Even if you have
        children of your own, you should be prepared to face problems associated with them. You are at times blind,
        unreasonable, impetuous and obstinate. Children will demand an abnormal amount of freedom, much more than you
        are willing to give. Your determination, at times verging on obstinacy, will create much alarm at home. Ancient
        astrologers have warned that a blend of these two traits, if not carefully balanced, can cause great
        inconveniences to you and others. Eventually you may decide to give up worldly attachments, become spiritual and
        detached from society, wander from place to place, and ultimately attain Moksha or spiritual awareness.

        Positioning of benefic planets in the fifth house from Lagna, Moon or Jupiter or benefic planets aspecting these
        houses is considered to favour well for having children. Such positive indications are seen in this horoscope.

        will make you angry, unsteady or insecure. Consequently, you may not be able to voice your ideas, or implement
        action when required. If you decide to clash with someone you love, the result can be full-scale war. The major
        mistake made by most of your friends, relatives, business associates, lover or mate is in attempting to force
        you to make a decision. Their efforts will not work, since you must decide at your own pace and time. But you
        should realise that it is beneficial for you and your brother to be friendly with your maternal uncle. You may
        have serious conflicts with your brother.</p>

    <h2>Marriage</h2>

        empower yourself and determine your professional goals. You will probably have unstable romantic relationships
        or even have the break-up of a serious relationship. You will get married fairly late. However, you will
        ultimately find a man worthy of you. You will love your husband unconditionally. Your meeting with your husband,
        or the way the marriage is proposed will be unusual in some way. There will be some peculiarity such as
        difference in age, height, or it may be a second marriage. You will do well far away from the place of your
        birth. Any head problem or injury should be attended to immediately.

        It is seen that Venus is afflicted by other planets. Hence, occasional disturbances in family life should be
        expected. Both partners are advised to take care to ensure the success of the family unit.

        motivation, health, character and personality, the differences can be intriguing. You need to be concerned about
        your spouse's needs and try to accommodate those needs in the best manner possible. You love to win arguments,
        but occasionally you should realize that losing may be more prudent. Accept the trials of family life with good
        humor. You may suffer on account of your health. Your foreign assignments will be beneficial to your
        relationship only if you consider its effects on both of you. If your partner's health is weak, your keen help
        and support is called for to save him/her from undue anxiety and worry.</p>

        analytical nature makes you suspicious and critical of others. You enjoy ferretting out other people's secrets.

    <h1>Dasa/Apahara predictions</h1>

    <p>In Indian Astrology, the Dasa system divides your life into periods and sub-periods which are influenced by
        various planets. The general trend of fortunes and misfortunes that can be expected are given below. The
        intensity of experiences may vary depending on the natal and transit positions of the planets. This needs
        further in-depth analysis. The effects which are not applicable to a child should be considered as applicable to
        the parents. Predictions are given starting from current dasa onwards. Details of apahara (bhukti) are given for
        a maximum of 40 years only. The starting and ending of each apahara is also shown. (The initial five years are
        skipped for infants). Strength of planets is judged by their positions in Saptavarga.</p>

    <h1>Graha dosha and remedies</h1>


    <p>Kuja dosha present</p>
    <p>Rahu dosha not present</p>
    <p>Ketu dosha not present</p>


    <h2>Kuja dosha and remedies</h2>
    <p>Great importance is attached to the effect of KUJA in a horoscope. Kuja plays an important role in determining
        marriage compatibility. Often people say that there is Kuja dosham in a horoscope simply because Kuja is in the
        7th. or 8th. house. However, authentic books on astrology gives several rules of exception by which Kuja dosha
        can be considered as nullified. A proper analysis on this basis is given below to see if there is Kuja dosham in
        your horoscope or not.</p>
    <p>In this horoscope, Kuja (Mars) is in the Twelfth house.</p>
    <p>This position gives some dosham.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Explanation</p>
    <p>Thoughtful and realistic nature will help you lead a happy family life. You are capable to come up against
        unfavorable situations with confident and determined efforts. Always have a clever planning and be reasonable
        with your expenses. You wouldn't be fortunate enough to enjoy what you really deserve. You can win against the
        allegations, believing in your integrity. More concern on the needs of your family members can make you a
        happier person. Avoid being stubborn and maintain a friendly ambience inside your home.</p>
    <strong><span class="gdres highlight red">Kuja Dosha is seen</span> in Rosna's horoscope</strong>
    <h3>Remedies to Kuja Dosha</h3>
    <p>To alleviate the bad effects of Kuja in twelfth house, you can follow the below mentioned remedies.</p>
    <p>Get a Subrahmania yantra and keep it in your puja room. Also, do puja offering to Lord Subrahmania on 5 alternate
        Suklapaksha Fridays.</p>


    <h2>Rahu and Ketu dosha and remedies</h2>
    <p>Rahu and Ketu are shadowy planets. Their movement is interrelated and as parts of one body they are at all times
        just opposite to each other but keeping in view of aspect (drishti), they can be regarded together.
        In general, Rahu carries the positive and beneficial tone of Jupiter and hence stands for growth and development
        and self help while Ketu expresses the restrictions and obstacles of Saturn and hence thought to restrict
        growth. In this way Rahu represents positive objectives and Ketu denotes the easy way out with little
        opportunity for growth.
        Thus Rahu signifies materialism and desires, whereas Ketu signifies spiritual tendencies and process of the
        refinement of materialization to spirit but obstacles in the material realm. Rahu is considered to be wile,
        deceitful and dishonest.</p>

    <h1>Dasa Remedies</h1>

    <p>This prediction is for the age from 22 to 90</p>


    <p>The remedies for the harmful effects of dasa
        The analysis of the general trend of fortunes and misfortunes, during the dasa of each planet, is based on the
        planetary position in the horoscope. The examination of the benefic and malefic effects of the planets shows
        that some dasa periods are not generally favorable to you. In order to mitigate the harmful effects of the
        unfavourable dasa periods, you must observe certain remedial rites.
        The unfavourable dasa periods in this horoscope and the remedial rites to be observed during that period are
        given below.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Dasa: Rahu </h2>
    <p>Now you are going through the dasa period of Rahu. </p>
    <p>Rahu is in Fifth Bhava.<br>

        Therefore you may occasionally face unfavorable experiences during this dasa.<br></p>
    <p>Rosna, according to the planetary position in this horoscope, you are likely to undergo adverse experiences
        during Rahu dasa. During this period things may happen which will affect your mental stability. You may be the
        victim of anxiety and unnecessary fear. Your lifestyle may change because of impractical notions.
        The intensity of the harmful effects of Rahu dasa varies according to the positional variation of Rahu. Some of
        the difficulties that you may have to face, when Rahu is in unfavourable positions, are given below.
        When Rahu is debilitated you will be attracted to intoxicants. The opportunities to use your abilities may
        decline. You may not get the chance to interact with good folks.
        As you are likely to be poisoned during this period, you must take care while eating and traveling. Some times
        your emotions may be uncontrollable. You may overlook the value of time.
        During this period you may not have company. You may be affected with skin diseases. You may lack decency in
        speech.
        If you experience an increase in these sorts of troubles during Rahu dasa, you can easily deduce that Rahu is in
        unfavourable positions. Those who are more affected by these troubles must adopt the ways to appease Rahu.
        Appeasing Rahu not only nullifies its harmful effects but also makes your life prosperous.
        Based on the detailed examination of this horoscope, the specific directions you are to follow in the Rahu dasa
        are given below.</p>
    <h3>Rahu dasa remedies</h3>
    <p>This remedy is for the Rahu dasa duration (from age 22y 8m 19d to 40y 8m 18d)</p>
    <h3>Dress</h3>
    <p>Black or dark coloured dresses are dear to Rahu. Therefore wear black dresses, while worshipping Nagas or
        visiting temples, to appease Rahu.</p>
    <h3>LifeStyle</h3>
    <p>Your lifestyle in the Rahu dasa period should complement the requirements of Rahu. Rahu dasa mostly influences
        thoughts and feelings. Therefore you must stay away from those sports which may disturb your mental stability.
        Keep busy with out giving isolation and day dreaming a chance. Stay away from those who recommend things like
        liquor, immoral activities and drugs as a respite to emotional problems. Getting involved in activities which
        give you self confidence and keeping distance from those you are mentally estranged with will be beneficial.
        Protect the kavu (dense wood where Kaali and the serpent-god Naga are worshipped) in your family, if there is
        any. Keep away from untimely travel and unnatural foods. Try to spend most of your time in peaceful environment.
    </p>

    <p>Chant this prayer daily, waking from sleep, while facing east in your bed.</p>
    <h3>Fasting (Vratham)</h3>
    <p>The term 'fasting' signifies the practice of frugality in the consumption of food materials. Above all, the
        ultimate motive of fasting and observing rites is to attain all kinds of purity by subduing your body, mind and
        utterance. You should fast on the days which are relevant to the planet and the days special to you. As Rahu
        don't have any dominating day in the week, worshipping Naga gods and visiting Naga temples while fasting on
        every birth star day is beneficial. You can also fast on the star days like Ardra, Swati, Satabhisha, and on
        Sundays.
        Abstain from consuming alcohol, non-vegetarian foods and other intoxicants while fasting. Natural foods like
        fruits, vegetables, and green leaves- which help digestion- are the suitable food for these days. Refrain from
        eating cereals, oily, hot and sour food. You can fast partially or fully according to the intensity of the
        harmful effects. It is not appropriate to indulge in pomp and pleasure while fasting. Your fasting will be
        fruitful only if you restrict your expression and emotion.</p>

    <h3>Flowers</h3>
    <p>You can wear blue or black tinged flowers like blue Clitoria Ternata (Neela Shangu pushpam), blue hibiscus etc to

    <p>Some poojas and sacrificial offerings are suggested to appease Mercury. The rites to gratify Mercury are usually
        performed in the temples where one of Lord Vishnu's incarnations is consecrated. The sacrificial offering in
        which Acsyranthus Aspera (Kadalaadichamatha) is used as the main ingredient is suggested to gratify Mercury. The
        poojas and sacrificial offerings should be performed according to the expert advice of the astrologers.

        planets are consecrated will reduce the harmful effects.</p>

    <h1>AshtakaVarga Predictions</h1>

    <p>Ashtakavarga system is a predictive method of Indian Astrology that uses a system of points based upon planetary
        positions. Ashtakavarga means eightfold categorization. It depicts eightfold strength of planets excluding the
        nodes of the Moon but including the ascendant. It is worked out according to certain well-established rules for
        measuring the planetary strength. The strength of each planet and the power and intensity of their influence
        depends upon the location of other planets and the ascendant in relation to it. Eight full points are assigned
        to each planet. They can obtain strength varying from zero to 8 points which, plotted on different signs in a
        chart, determine the possibility of a transiting planet in inducing auspicious or other effects during its
        sojourn in a particular sign. Events and their timings are to a large extent determined by the positioning of
        particular points. Depending on their negative or positive influences the native can take remedial measures or
        pre-empt unpleasant possibilities, just by being aware of the likely consequences. To be forewarned is to be
        forearmed --- the planets are one of the best guides to help condition mans mind to the possibilities of his
        future.</p>

        careful while brushing with the authorities as the presence of two Bindus in Saturn's ashtakavarga indicates the
        likelihood of incarceration. You are also prone to ill-health. It would be prudent to look after your health and
        keep official documentation up- to-date to avoid punishment.</p>
